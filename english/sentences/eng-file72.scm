Why are you so smart?
I can hear you.
Did anybody tell you anything about it?
Are there dogs that eat raw fish?
Will you lend me your dictionary?
Are you younger than him?
Do you drink beer?
Are you staying at this hotel?
Does he like China?
Have you finished your work?
May I talk to Ms. Brown?
Can I rest a bit?
Can I have a copy of it?
Does school start at eight-thirty?
What kind of car do you drive?
Can I sit here?
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
Change the flag, please.
Two ice creams, please.
Why can't we have pizza?
On your mark! Get set! Go!
Why would you marry a woman if you like men?
Shall we play?
