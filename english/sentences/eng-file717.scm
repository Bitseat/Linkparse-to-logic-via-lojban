You're such a liar.
I cannot thank you too much.
Thank you very much for your help.
Thanks for helping me when I was sad.
But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.
A skyful isn't enough to have written upon it that I love you.
I like pizza very much.
I like snow a lot.
I like the sun a lot.
I'm sort of happy.
