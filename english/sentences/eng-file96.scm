This is extraordinary.
He was proud of his daughter.
She has one too.
Our teacher said to us, 'Don't leave the room.'
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
I'm 17, too.
I like busy places.
I'm aware of it.
I drive a Porsche.
I'm tired of TV.
He never lies.
He is not afraid of anything.
He is the eldest.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
