I would like to live in France.
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
I put it in your room.
I don't have a car.
I don't have a bicycle.
I have a dog and two cats.
I ask myself what he did.
I hate everyone, and everyone hates me.
I'd like some tea, please.
I like to eat sweets.
I am pleased to see you.
I'm loved.
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.
I dreamed a strange dream.
My dream is to go to Japan someday.
I'm staying at that hotel.
I would like to do something else today.
I'm motivated.
Despite that I succeeded.
I'm busy.
I'm not willing to take that risk.
Would that the trees might speak on behalf of all things that have roots, and punish those that wrong them!
I'm ugly.
I am quenched.
I'm short.
I can hardly hear you.
I saw a beautiful bird.
I want to run.
There will be consequences.
It will rain tomorrow.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
I play a little guitar.
With me everything is OK.
I've come to save Tom.
I've come to save the princess.
I'm here to save you.
We banished him from the country.
I want to study German.
We left by train.
We are in a library.
We helped him financially.
We agree.
We live close to the station.
We'll do something.
We're no longer children.
I expect that in the far future, you will know about every day.
What have we done?
We know.
We believe the time of death was 2:20 p.m.
I'm sure of your success.
I want to speak in Lojban.
We're not wrong.
We do not know him.
We aren't going.
Inshallah, soon we'll be home.
We are annoying the teacher.
We'll wait.
What are we waiting for?
We'll go when it quits raining.
We go to the Buddhist shrine. It is beautiful.
We need something to eat.
We lack nothing.
I want to be cautious.
We were told to stay on the ship.
I think he's going to be sick.
What species of elk is it?
Being ill, I stayed at home all day long.
Why don't you wear a dress?
It's not raining.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
That's not what I meant.
It is not so.
It's not important to me what you decide to call me.
It's not safe here.
Aren't you ready?
It's hard to do.
This is difficult for Tom.
Today is going to be a good day!
No one will know.
It is impossible to do it.
No beer before four!
No one told me.
Absolutely nothing is permanent in life.
No one else knows what it's like to be me.
No clouds were in the sky.
There is no dog which is bigger than this one.
I don't care at all.
I have nothing better to do.
No house has only one roach in it.
Soon you'll get used to living by yourself.
I want to kiss you.
Nobody speaks to me.
Do you promise?
There's one piece left.
What are your top ten favorite movies?
I think that it's too big.
He lived in Spain, I think.
I think nobody has ever done such a thing before.
Please.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Is that what Tom would want?
Can you help me?
That was not necessary.
When he was a child, he lived in a small town.
He isn't alone anymore.
He wants to dance.
He wants to go to America.
He wants you to stay here.
He knows the truth.
He looks forward to having 200 visitors.
He doesn't know that I'm Japanese.
She doesn't know who the father is.
He didn't give me anything to eat.
He doesn't understand you.
He paid no attention to what she said.
He doesn't come here every day.
He is not a doctor.
He could not swim.
He likes to run.
He likes to cook.
She likes to read.
He likes to read books.
She likes to listen to music.
I was young once.
He likes to live in Tokyo.
He likes to watch TV.
He's on the train.
He never speaks unless spoken to.
He is my friend.
He's not working much at the moment.
He managed to climb the mountain.
Why?
Everyone in my family is happy.
You may kiss anybody.
Anything can happen.
I am ready to do anything for you.
I decided to learn Esperanto today.
I don't work today.
Everyone can help ensure that sentences sound correct, and are correctly spelled.
He comes back from Sydney today.
I want to dance.
Everyone laughs at someone who makes a mistake.
What do all have in common?
I was just lucky.
It's not likely but possible.
It is necessary.
Where is he running now?
I happen to be a good driver.
I'm going to bed.
