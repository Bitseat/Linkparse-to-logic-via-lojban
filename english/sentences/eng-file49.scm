This dog bites.
How much do you earn?
Look at that brilliant star.
It's chillier today.
Right now, I'm not hungry.
It's not clean.
There is no life without water.
A dog can't climb up a wall.
This is no joke.
Not all were satisfied.
He isn't dumber than you.
They howled with laughter.
He is the eldest.
